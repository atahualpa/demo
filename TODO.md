To use this work:
================

2) copy public/applcation.js

TODO:

1) Get a better logic for toggle
  Involves a container view, or some class or id, or some way to toggle.
  Just think if you were using jQuery, what would you do?
  
2) Listen to the change/submit events (in the edit form???)
  Update the model
  Possibly update the server as well
